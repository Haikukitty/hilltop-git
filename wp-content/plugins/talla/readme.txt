Things to consider
1. This is license is good for unlimited websites.
2. Make sure you generate and add a Google public and private key. This plugin won't work without it.
3. This plugin doesn't replace Divi's math captcha. So you will want to go through your forms and disable wherever captcha is used.
4. This is a very rudimentary plugin and does not come with support. If you see a bug, however, please contact us through our website.
